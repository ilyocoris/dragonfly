    Functions run by Triggers are run as System users and have full access to Services, Functions, and MongoDB Data.

    Access a mongodb service:
    const collection = context.services.get("mongodb-atlas").db("dragonfly").collection("events");
    const doc = collection.findOne({ name: "mongodb" });

    Note: In Atlas Triggers, the service name is defaulted to the cluster name.

    Call other named functions if they are defined in your application:
    const result = context.functions.execute("function_name", arg1, arg2);

    Access the default http client and execute a GET request:
    const response = context.http.get({ url: <URL> })

    Learn more about http client here: https://docs.mongodb.com/realm/functions/context/#context-http
