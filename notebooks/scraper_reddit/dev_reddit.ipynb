      "The only stock on this list worth buying would be NVDA, but I don't own it because while they're a great company I don't expect their bull run to last forever, and they could easily drop and then trade sideways for 5 years. When they announced the ARM deal, their stock price shot up. I read an analyst last week saying that he thinks the market is pricing the stock as if the ARM deal won't go through. There is a lot of bull eagerness to price it in twice. During the earnings call the executive was talking about the growth of GPUs in the data center, and blah blah blah. They're a great graphics chip company, but the ones going into the server room are integrated, mostly from AMD. Lots of companies have tried to adapt ARM chips for the server room. Nobody has had much success. Mostly because the it would have to be a cheaper option, with lower margins. Well, commodity margins to bring the data center CPU costs down isn't a big revenue center. But investors really loved what he said. It could go up for another 5 years and then crash, or it could pop next week.\n",
